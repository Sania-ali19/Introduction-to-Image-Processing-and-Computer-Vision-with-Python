üñºÔ∏è Image Processing and Computer Vision Projects
Image processing and computer vision tasks are essential in many applications, including image recognition, classification, restoration, and generation. Using libraries like PIL (Pillow) and NumPy, I have worked on key image manipulation tasks:

Displaying, cropping, flipping, and rotating images
Extracting color channels such as RGB or grayscale and performing pixel-level operations
Image segmentation and classification
Working with images via the cloud, including storage, transmission, and retrieval
üõ†Ô∏è Python Libraries for Image Processing
Python is my go-to language for these tasks because of its rich ecosystem of libraries for image processing, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based solutions. Some of the essential libraries I work with include:

Pillow (PIL): Great for basic image processing tasks like loading, manipulating, and saving images.
NumPy: Used to handle image data as arrays, enabling advanced operations.
OpenCV: A more advanced computer vision library for tasks like object detection and face recognition.
Matplotlib: Perfect for plotting and visualizing images in Python.
